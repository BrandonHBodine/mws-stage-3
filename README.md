#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Stage 2

### What do I do from here?

1. This project uses the Backend app provided by at [https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-2](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-2), it should be located in Backend folder of this repo. It must be started for this project to work correctly and avaliable at localhost:1337

2. The Frontend app uses webpack as the build and bundle tool. To start the development server run `npm run start` which will launch the app on localhost:8080.

3. For a production code run `npm run build` which will create a dist folder with the production vestion of the app. To test this enter the dist directory and run a python server with either `python3 -m http.server 8000` for python 3 or `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` for pyhton 2.
